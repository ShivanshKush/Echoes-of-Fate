## Game Concept

In **Echoes of Fate**, you play as a young man from a small village who awakens a powerful, latent **healing ability**. This “miracle” draws the attention of a **mysterious Church**, whose motives are uncertain.  
Are they here to **worship** you as a messiah, **condemn** you as a heretic, or **weaponize** your power?

Set in a **grim world** suffering from **environmental collapse**, you embark on a journey with two companions to uncover the truth.  
The world is filled with monstrous creatures — but the **greatest monsters are often human**.

> A narrative-driven RPG where your **choices have real consequences**.

## Core Features

### Psychological Narrative

There is **no visible morality meter** — only perception and consequence.

### Fast-Paced Combat
A **3-character party system** inspired by *Expedition 33*, offering strategic, dynamic turn-based combat.

### Visible Encounters
Enemies appear directly on the map, allowing tactical choice between **engagement** or **avoidance**.

### World Exploration
Explore **towns, forests, and dungeons** filled with side quests, puzzles, and hidden lore.

### Grim-Dark Tone
Inspired by *The Witcher* — a world where people act out of **fear, greed, and desperation**.
